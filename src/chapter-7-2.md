Collaboration and communication are important techniques for navigating ethical dilemmas. Social workers should communicate openly and honestly with clients, colleagues, and other professionals involved in the case, seeking collaboration and input where appropriate. This can help ensure that all parties are working towards the best possible outcome for the client, while also upholding ethical and professional standards.
