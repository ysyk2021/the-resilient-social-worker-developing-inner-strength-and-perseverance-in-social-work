### Trauma

Trauma refers to the lasting emotional, psychological, and physical effects caused by experiencing or witnessing a distressing event. Social workers often work with clients who have experienced various types of trauma, such as abuse, violence, or natural disasters.

### Secondary Trauma

Secondary trauma, also known as vicarious trauma or compassion fatigue, occurs when social workers experience the emotional toll of hearing about and witnessing others' traumatic experiences. The empathic connection formed with clients can lead to significant emotional and psychological strain on the social worker.
