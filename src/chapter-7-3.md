The Importance of Ethical Decision-Making

Ethical decision-making is crucial in ensuring that social workers provide care that is aligned with professional standards and values. This involves considering the potential impact of decisions on clients, colleagues, and the broader community.

* Developing a personal framework for ethical decision-making, such as the NASW ethical decision-making model

By incorporating these strategies into their practice, social workers can better navigate ethical dilemmas and make decisions that align with their professional values.

Setting and Maintaining Boundaries

In addition to ethical decision-making, setting and maintaining boundaries is also essential for providing effective care. This involves establishing clear limits on what services can be provided and ensuring that these limits are communicated clearly to clients.

Strategies for Setting and Maintaining Boundaries
